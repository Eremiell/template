# C++ Project Template

As you're probably well aware, there're dozen a dime C++ projet templates out there. Why start another one?

This template is based on my existing workflow, builds on my existing scripts and config files, and suits my personal needs. I haven't seen one that would really be close to what I'm aiming for here, but naturally it's all personal preferences.

I'm using this template to start off all my projects, personal, educational, and private/commercial, unless there're other requirements. Access to it may be beneficial not only to wide public, but primarily to my students.
